# About
This repository hosts a collection of core Terraform modules that implement the governance standards set by the terraform-governance-framework-example-interceptor-module. 
Each module within this repository is designed to create specific resources that comply with the centralized governance policies, including consistent naming, tagging, and configuration checks. 
These modules are essential for developers needing pre-configured, compliant infrastructure components that align with organizational standards and practices.
